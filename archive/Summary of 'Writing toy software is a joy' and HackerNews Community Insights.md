The article "Writing toy software is a joy" by bundie explores the enjoyment and educational value of creating small, personal software projects often referred to as "toy software." These projects may not be highly polished or production-ready but serve as a playground for learning and creativity.

### Technical Context
Toy software includes projects like creating a regex engine, a simple shell, or even a small game engine. Such projects challenge developers to understand concepts deeply by building them from scratch rather than relying on existing tools or frameworks. This hands-on approach helps reinforce foundational knowledge in areas like algorithms, system design, and programming languages.

### Why Is This Popular?
1. **Rediscovering Joy**: Many experienced developers mentioned missing the joy they once had when programming simple projects without pressure.
2. **Learning Tool**: Toy projects provide a safe space for experimentation, problem-solving, and learning new technologies without business constraints.
3. **Creative Outlet**: Some find it a way to express creativity and build something bespoke and meaningful for themselves.
4. **AI Integration**: Users note that modern AI tools (like Large Language Models - LLMs) have sped up development on toy projects, allowing quicker progress and feature additions.
