A recent proposal aims to enhance browser security by restricting websites from accessing users' local networks without explicit permission. This comes as a response to privacy and security issues where websites could silently scan and interact with local network devices like routers, printers, and IoT devices.

üîç **Technical Background:**
- Currently, browsers allow websites to send HTTP requests to local IP addresses (such as 192.168.x.x), which might expose internal network devices.
- The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy restricts websites from reading responses from other origins unless explicitly allowed, but simple requests (like GET or POST with common content types) still go through, possibly triggering side effects on vulnerable devices.
- Locally installed applications often use localhost servers for communication with websites; these use cases require careful handling so as not to be disrupted.
- IPv6 introduces complications in defining "local" addresses, since local networks may also use global routable IPs.

üîê **Why is this proposal popular?**
- Users and security-conscious developers want to prevent malicious websites from probing or exploiting local network devices without consent.
- It aims to provide a permission prompt (similar to accessing camera or microphone) to give users control.
- The proposal balances usability and security by allowing local-to-local communications but blocking cross-origin local network requests from public websites by default.

üí¨ **Community Sentiments & Points:**

- **Security Concerns:** Many users and developers support restricting arbitrary access to the local network, highlighting risks such as device exploitation and privacy breaches ([44184967](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44184967), [44185806](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185806)).
- **Usability Concerns:** Some point out that legitimate applications (e.g., password managers, local device UIs, IoT device controllers) require localhost or local network access, so blocking everything could break functionality unless a sensible permission model is in place ([44185410](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185410), [44185982](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185982)).
- **IPv6 Challenges:** The community discusses difficulties in defining "local network" in the context of IPv6, since addresses may be globally routable yet part of internal networks ([44186230](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44186230), [44185429](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185429)).
- **Criticism of Permission Prompts:** Some users believe that permission prompts are ineffective as most users blindly accept, and a better security model or user education is required ([44185227](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185227), [44186357](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44186357)).
- **Browsers & Platform Control:** Debates continue about whether browsers or operating systems should enforce such restrictions, with references to mobile OS permission models and past browser security zones ([44184469](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44184469), [44185340](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185340)).
- **Existing Solutions:** Extensions like uBlock Origin can block local network probing, but may require manual configuration ([44184799](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44184799)).

üéØ **Example Use-Cases:**
- Local password managers interacting with native apps via localhost servers ([44185410](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185410)).
- Centrally hosted web UIs accessing local IoT devices without sending data outside the LAN ([44185982](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185982)).

This topic is gaining attention due to the increased number of local network devices people have and the risk of exploitation via browsers. The community is interested but cautious about balancing security and functionality.
