# Summary of Phoenix.new - Remote AI Runtime for Phoenix

Phoenix.new is an innovative AI-powered development environment designed specifically for Elixir and the Phoenix web framework. It offers a remote runtime where AI-driven agents can build, refactor, and debug Elixir/Phoenix applications in a containerized, isolated environment. By integrating tightly with Fly.io, it provisions IDE instances globally, close to users, and leverages advanced language models like Claude 3 Opus to deliver smarter coding assistance.

## Technical Insights ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Remote Agent Runtime:** The AI agent operates in a container separate from your application or IDE, communicating through Phoenix channels. This isolation enhances safety and flexibility.
- **AI Model:** Phoenix.new primarily uses Claude 3 Opus for its agentic work, excelling at generating Elixir and Phoenix code despite Elixir traditionally having less training data available to LLMs compared to JavaScript or Python.
- **IDE Integration:** The environment includes web-based VS Code embedding and a headless Chrome browser that the AI agent can drive to test front-end features dynamically.
- **Fly.io Integration:** Apps generated start as standard Phoenix projects (using SQLite by default) and can be exported and run locally, maintaining compatibility and freedom from vendor lock-in.

## Why is it Popular? üåü
1. **Solves Elixir AI Gap:** Many developers were concerned LLMs don't support Elixir/Phoenix well. Phoenix.new addresses this gap, making Elixir development with AI more viable.
2. **Full Development Environment:** It‚Äôs more than code generation ‚Äî agents can run complex workflows including browser automation, testing, and state inspection.
3. **Remote & Scalable:** Being cloud-hosted with global clusters enables low-latency experience worldwide.
4. **Built by Phoenix Creator:** Credibility from Chris McCord and Fly.io team boosts confidence.

- **Concerns and critiques:**
  - Some skepticism about closed-source nature, pricing transparency, and vendor lock-in ([44328834](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44328834), [44333148](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44333148)).
  - Discussion around the Elixir ecosystem‚Äôs challenges like abandoned packages and lack of official SDKs, especially for cloud integrations ([44328928](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44328928), [44330895](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44330895)).
  - AI-generated code quality varies; some find AI frustrating for large-scale or complex changes ([44334315](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44334315)).
  - Pricing seems expensive compared to competitors, and some want clearer usage terms ([44329766](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329766), [44329382](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329382)).

- **Technical questions answered by Chris McCord:**
  - The agent communicates through Phoenix channels and runs remotely, not embedded inside the BEAM VM of the app ([44329679](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329679), [44330072](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44330072)).
  - Apps generated are typical Phoenix projects runnable locally off the shelf ([44330059](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44330059)).
  - Plans to enable SSH access and local deployment are in consideration ([44329010](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329010)).

- **Philosophical discussions:** Some debate the impact of AI on developer jobs and worker welfare, with two sides expressing different views on automation and employment ([44329303](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329303), [44329862](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44329862)).

## Simple Example of Usage
You can sign up on Fly.io, create a Phoenix.new IDE instance, and the AI agent will help you start building a Phoenix web app. It handles backend and frontend, tests the UI automatically using a headless browser, and monitors server logs‚Äîall remotely. You can clone the source code and run it locally with standard Elixir commands:

```bash
git clone <your_app_repo_url>
cd your_app
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
```
