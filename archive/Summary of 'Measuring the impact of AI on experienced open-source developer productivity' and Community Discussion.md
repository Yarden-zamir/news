The article covers a study conducted in early 2025 investigating how AI tools, specifically large language models (LLMs) like Cursor and Claude Code, affect the productivity of experienced open-source software (OSS) developers. The study involved 16 developers who worked on tasks randomly assigned to be AI-assisted or not. Surprisingly, the study found that AI tools caused a significant slowdown in developer productivity for most participants, while a quarter saw increased performance. One developer with over 50 hours of Cursor experience showed a positive speedup, indicating a high learning curve for effective AI-assisted development.

üîç **Technical insights:**
- Developers spent less % time actively coding and more time interacting with AI, including prompting and waiting for output, which contributed to a perceived but inaccurate feeling of speedup.
- AI is more effective for new or unfamiliar codebases rather than mature projects where developers are highly familiar.
- The quality of AI-generated code still requires careful review and refactoring.
- The learning curve for effectively using AI coding assistants is steep and varies between individuals.

üí¨ **Community sentiments & discussions:**
- Many commenters agree with the high learning curve and that AI tools haven't yet reached the point of outright productivity boosts for senior developers ([comment 44523442](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523442)).
- Some developers find AI helpful for routine, boilerplate tasks, debugging unfamiliar languages, or acting as a "rubber duck" for problem explanation ([comment 44524101](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44524101), [comment 44524040](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44524040)).
- Skepticism exists around whether AI tools truly improve productivity or if developers' perception is biased by the feeling of mental ease ([comment 44523608](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523608), [comment 44525349](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44525349)).
- There is debate about whether AI tools might cause skill atrophy among developers relying heavily on them ([comment 44525453](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44525453), [comment 44525216](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44525216)).
- Many appreciate the transparency and rigor of the study and would like expanded research with more participants and longer observation periods ([comment 44523844](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523844), [comment 44524365](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44524365)).
- Discussions on how AI's benefits differ by task complexity, developer experience, and codebase familiarity are ongoing.

üî• **Why is this popular?**
This topic hits at the heart of current tech debates: AI is hyped to revolutionize software development, yet this study presents sobering data showing that such revolution might not yet be realized and might come with nuances like a steep learning curve and misperception of speedup. Many practitioners are eager to see real-world impact cases beyond hype, making this study and discussion very timely and relevant.

üìù **Example Use Case from the Community:**
A developer shared that AI helped him add about 80 lines of code quickly by converting a known algorithm in his preferred language into a new unfamiliar language, after which he only needed to make minor stylistic adjustments ([comment 44523343](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523343)).
