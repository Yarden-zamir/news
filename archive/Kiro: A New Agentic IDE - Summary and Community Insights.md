# Summary of Kiro: A New Agentic IDE üöÄ

Kiro is a new AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by an AWS team but positioned as a standalone product that does not require an AWS account. It is designed to enhance software development by bringing a concept called **spec-driven development** ‚Äî a structured approach used internally at Amazon to create detailed technical requirements, design documents (with diagrams), and task lists from basic high-level prompts.

This approach aims to move developers beyond quick-and-loose "vibe coding" into more disciplined software engineering. Kiro integrates AI with real development workflows, helping break down large projects into manageable tasks and maintaining context through multiple development stages.

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Transforms rough ideas into detailed specs, designs, and task breakdowns to support long-term maintainability and clarity.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Kiro acts as an agent that can execute multi-turn workflows triggered by user interactions.
- **Integration with Models:** Supports models like Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0, powered by AWS Bedrock with model selection capabilities.
- **Steering Rules:** Customizable markdown-based rules enhance context understanding and consistency across codebases.
- **Forked VSCode Base:** Kiro builds on a fork of the open-source VSCode, adding AI features and agentic workflows beyond typical plugins.

## Why Is It Popular? üî•

- **Unique Spec-Driven Approach:** Most AI coding tools focus on code autocomplete or direct generation. Kiro introduces engineering discipline by emphasizing specifications and design before coding, which resonates with developers needing maintainable, large-scale projects. 
- **Backed by AWS:** Official support and development by Amazon/AWS provide credibility and assure enterprise-grade features, but the product remains open to non-AWS users.
- **Community Enthusiasm:** Early users enjoy the balance between "vibe coding" and rigorous software engineering Kiro enables.
- **Competitive Pricing and Model Options:** Flexible pricing and support for different LLMs models attract users seeking alternatives to existing tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Amazon Q CLI.

## Community Conversation Highlights üí¨

**Positive Sentiments:**
- Developers appreciate Kiro's ability to generate detailed specs and task lists, making large codebase management easier ([comment 44560677](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44560677), [44562248](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44562248)).
- The modular, multi-file format (requirements, design, tasks) allows for better project structuring ([comment 44561530](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561530)).
- Users commend Kiro for supporting agentic workflows and model selection ([comments 44561480](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561480), [44561508](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561508)).
- Some report enjoyable development experiences, including writing an entire game project mostly AI-coded with Kiro ([comment 44561071](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561071)).

**Critiques & Cautions:**
- Some users express skepticism due to AWS's history of half-baked AI products (e.g., Amazon Q console), questioning long-term trust ([comment 44561627](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561627), [44562294](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44562294)).
- The high CPU usage during code indexing was noted as a concern ([comments 44562880](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44562880), [44563462](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44563462)).
- Some users would prefer AI integrations directly into existing IDEs rather than new VSCode forks to avoid switching pains ([comments 44564245](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44564245), [44561512](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561512)).
- Discussions around the AI model agnosticism and whether Kiro can outperform others were mixed; many agree current models require skilled humans in the loop ([comment 44561756](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561756), [44561815](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44561815)).
- Questions around pricing, telemetry, and data privacy appeared frequently, with options to opt-out of data sharing ([comments 44563851](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44563851), [44565507](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44565507)).

**Overall Community Mood:** Mixed but leaning positive üü¢ with users excited about the spec-driven engineering concept and agentic workflows but cautious about switching costs and AWS product reliability.
