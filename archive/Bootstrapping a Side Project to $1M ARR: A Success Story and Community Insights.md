# Summary

This article highlights the inspiring journey of building **ProjectionLab**, a financial planning SaaS that reached over $1 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in four years without raising any outside funding. The project began as a side project to scratch the personal financial planning itch of the founder, Kyle, and grew organically through persistent daily effort, community engagement, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Technical Overview

ProjectionLab is a long-term financial planning tool designed primarily for the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) community. Its core value comes from enabling users to project retirement scenarios with tax-aware and customizable assumptions. The product is built with global flexibility, including international tax presets (e.g., Netherlands), making it accessible beyond just the US market.

Key technical points include:
- High profit margins (~65%) maintained even while reinvesting for growth.
- Focus on simplicity and usability, allowing users to try a sandbox version without providing personal information.
- Ongoing development includes managing tradeoffs such as whether to implement automated account linking for live balance updates ‚Äî a highly requested but complex and expensive feature.
- Organic growth via content marketing and strong emphasis on engaging with the user community through channels like Discord.
