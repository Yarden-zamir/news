# Summary

The article discusses a famous exhibit at the Chicago Federal Reserve, which displays a cube claimed to contain $1 million in $1 bills. However, upon closer examination and counting, it turns out the cube actually contains roughly $1.5 million, a 50% discrepancy from the advertised amount. The exhibit box was apparently constructed based on rough calculations or for aesthetic reasons, leading to either an overestimation or a hollow interior with filler materials like air or old paper inside, rather than being a solid cube of cash.

## Technical Explanation

- The cube is comprised of stacks of $1 bills arranged to form a large cube approximately 50 inches (~1.27 meters) on each side.
- Each bill measures about 6.14 √ó 2.61 inches and a stack of 100 bills is about 0.43 inches thick.
- Counting stacks and bills implies the cube holds about 1.5 million dollars, i.e., 50% more than stated.
- The discrepancy is likely due to non-uniform packing, possible hollow areas, or deliberate oversizing for visual impact.
- Bills used might be retired or decommissioned notes, possibly with zero monetary value, used for display only, minimizing real cost to the Fed.

## Why It‚Äôs Popular

Many find the story intriguing because it highlights how visible representations of money, especially by authoritative institutions like the Fed, can be misleading or inaccurately portrayed. It sparks curiosity and humor about government inefficiency, budgeting, accounting, and exhibit design. The topic connects money, art, and skepticism in an engaging way.

## Simple Usage Example (Counting Dots in an Image)

The article also highlights a custom-made simple web app the author created to count red dots in an image by clicking on them, a task surprisingly missing as a ready-made browser tool. This can be useful in various areas such as biology or inventory counting. Such a tool allows you to:

- Upload an image
- Click to place a dot on each item to count
- Automatically track the number of clicks (counted items)

This example shows how simple software can address small but real needs easily missed by commercial products.
