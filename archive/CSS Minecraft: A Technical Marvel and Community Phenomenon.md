The article "CSS Minecraft" showcases a stunning recreation of the Minecraft game purely using HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript! This achievement is especially remarkable because Minecraft is a 3D voxel-based game, and rendering something that complex with just CSS is quite an engineering and creative feat. The project consists of about 46,022 lines of HTML and only around 480 lines of CSS, demonstrating an ingenious use of CSS capabilities ([source](https://benjaminaster.com/css-minecraft/)).

### Technical Highlights:
- The entire voxel (3D cube) world is implemented using traditional HTML inputs of type radio and associated labels to manage voxel faces and states. This means each block in the 3D space corresponds to some HTML elements controlled via CSS states and selectors.
- Camera rotation and movement are ingeniously controlled using CSS animations toggled via the :active pseudo-class on buttons, a neat trick to simulate interactivity without JavaScript.
- The CSS uses advanced tricks such as gradients, box-shadows, and complex selectors to emulate textures and 3D effects.
- Despite being a mega-demo, it remains surprisingly performant in modern browsers like Firefox and Safari, although some users report issues on mobile Safari which can crash the page during heavy interactions.

This is the type of project that challenges the limits of CSS and browser capabilities, and while impractical for regular use, it serves as a creative playground and a testament to the power of CSS and HTML.

### Why Itâ€™s Popular:
- The project taps into the nostalgic and massive popularity of Minecraft, which many people know or have played.
- It's a jaw-dropping example of how far CSS and HTML can be pushed beyond their typical uses.
- The community admires the creativity and the sheer scale of the implementation, sparking many technical discussions about CSS art, browser performance, and web programming paradigms.

### Beginner-friendly Explanation
Imagine building a complex 3D LEGO world, but instead of using a game engine or programming language like JavaScript, everything is made using the styles and basic HTML tags your web browser knows. This project pushes the limits of what CSS (the code that styles webpages) can do, showing that with a lot of creativity, you can make interactive games or art without traditional programming.

### Summary example:
To create interaction without JavaScript, the project uses HTML radio buttons where each button represents a block, and CSS styles change the appearance and simulate the 3D view. The camera moves by toggling CSS animations on buttons pressed by the user (using :active). This clever trick uses only CSS and HTML elements and selectors to produce an entire cube world that can be navigated.
