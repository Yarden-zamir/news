# Summary

The article presents a developer's journey of rewriting their Mac desktop application from Electron to Rust using Tauri. The original Electron app was quite large (close to 1GB) and had performance bottlenecks despite Electron's popularity for cross-platform desktop app development. By switching to Rust with Tauri, the team achieved significantly smaller binary sizes (~15-25MB) and better performance, especially for their media indexing and search application.

The choice of Rust and Tauri was motivated by the desire for cross-platform support (starting with Apple Silicon Macs) and leveraging Rust's efficiency for computation-intensive tasks such as ML model inference using ONNX Runtime. The rewrite also allowed the team to bundle native Redis modules for vector search embeddings, which proved more effective than alternatives like SQLite vector extensions for their use case.

# Technical Highlights

- **Electron vs Tauri:** Electron bundles a full Chromium browser, resulting in large app sizes. Tauri uses native system webviews (Safari WKWebView on Mac, WebView2 on Windows), making app sizes much smaller, but at the cost of cross-platform rendering inconsistencies.

- **Rust Backend:** The app backend and core processing are written in Rust, offering performance benefits and more maintainable code compared to Node.js in Electron.

- **ONNX Runtime:** Used for machine learning model inference (specifically CLIP models for image embedding), integrated using the Ort crate in Rust.

- **Redis for Vector Storage:** The team embedded Redis to store vector embeddings for fast similarity searches, outperforming SQLite in their scenario.

- **Cross-Platform Challenges:** System webviews cause UI inconsistencies across OSes. Electron provides consistent UI by embedding Chromium but with larger binaries.
