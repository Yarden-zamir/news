# uv: The Ultra-Fast Python Package & Project Manager Written in Rust

### Overview

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. Its key appeal lies in significantly improving the speed and ease of Python environment and dependency management compared to traditional tools like pip, poetry, and conda.

### Technical Highlights üöÄ
- **Written in Rust:** Rust is a systems programming language known for speed and safety. This contributes to uv‚Äôs blazing-fast performance compared to traditional Python-based tools.
- **Caching and Hard Links:** uv caches downloaded packages and uses hard links to avoid copying files multiple times, drastically reducing install times and storage usage.
- **Parallel Operations:** uv parallelizes certain operations such as downloading dependencies, which speeds up the overall package installation.
- **PEP 723 Support:** uv supports the Python Enhancement Proposal 723 for script dependencies, allowing scripts to specify their own dependencies.
- **Integration:** uv can replace pip, poetry, and pyenv by handling dependency management, Python versions, and virtual environments seamlessly and more efficiently.

### Why Is uv Popular? ‚≠ê
- Users repeatedly mention how much faster it is than pip, poetry, and conda, often describing the speed as "unfairly fast" and almost suspicious ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358367), [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358107)).
- Simplifies Python packaging workflows by automating environment management without the need to manually activate virtual environments.
- Works well on constrained or shared servers where storage and permissions are limited.
- Reduces the complexity and pain points historically associated with Python dependencies and environment management.

### Community Conversations and Sentiments üí¨
- **Excitement About Speed and Ease:** Many users share how uv felt almost too fast, initially causing confusion but soon led to permanent adoption ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358107), [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358123)).
- **Comparison with Other Tools:** There is discussion about uv being a better alternative to pip, poetry, and conda for many Python use cases. Users also appreciate Ruff, a linter from the same team, often used alongside uv ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358123)).
- **Enterprise Concerns:** Some community members expressed concerns about the sustainability and business model of uv‚Äôs backers, Astral, which is a VC-backed startup. There are worries about potential paywalls or vendor lock-in but the founder has emphasized an open-source core and enterprise services as a revenue path ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358216)).
- **Learning Curve & Documentation:** Some users new to Python tooling find uv easier to use but wish for better native documentation that doesn‚Äôt assume knowledge of legacy tools like pip and poetry ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358555)).
- **Script Running Features:** Users love the ability to add script-specific dependencies and run scripts with one command (`uv run script.py`) and use a simple hashbang line (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`). This simplifies scripting workflows ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44359113), [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358181)).

### Example Usage ‚ú®
Run a Python script with dependencies automatically handled:
```
uv run my_script.py
```
Add a dependency for a script:
```
uv add requests --script my_script.py
```
Use a hashbang line in a script to auto-run with uv:
```python
#! /usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# dependencies = ["python-dateutil"]

import dateutil
# Your code here
```
