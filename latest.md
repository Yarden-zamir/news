## 🚨 What Happened?
In 2017, a change was introduced in the U.S. tax code under **Section 174** that took effect in 2022. This change shifted how companies deduct their Research & Development (R&D) expenses, especially software development costs:

- **Old rule:** Companies could immediately deduct 100% of R&D expenses (including salaries for software engineers) in the year they were incurred. This acted like a tax break, reducing taxable income significantly.
- **New rule:** Companies must now **amortize** (spread out) these expenses over 5 years (or even 15 years for some offshore costs).

This means companies cannot write off all the money they pay for software development immediately but must spread the deduction over multiple years.

## 💡 Why Is This Important?
Software development is a huge expense for tech companies.

- Immediate deductions helped startups and growing companies reduce their tax bills early on when cash flow is tight.
- The amortization requirement makes software developers effectively more expensive for businesses because they pay tax on "pretend" profits created by limited deductions.
- This shift can lead to increased tax bills for companies that are still burning cash, forcing layoffs and reduced hiring.

## 📊 Effects and Community Reactions

### Popular points from the discussion:

- **Impact on Startups:** Startups suffer the most because they often take several years before becoming profitable. Having to amortize expenses reduces cash flow, shrinking their runway and making it harder to survive ([comment 44204103](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204103), [44207192](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44207192)).

- **Effect on Big Tech:** Established companies like Google or Microsoft amortize already and have more stable revenue, so the change is less impactful for them ([comment 44205149](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44205149)). However, some remarks suggest that even they feel the shift's cash flow impact ([comment 44183441](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44183441)).

- **Tax & Accounting Confusion:** The shift confuses many about whether software development salaries are expenses or capital investments. The tax code now treats software as a capital asset requiring depreciation, unlike other employee salaries which are operating expenses ([comment 44204353](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204353), [44204816](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204816)).

- **Criticism of Policy and Politics:** Many see this as a poorly designed political tactic wrapped into a larger tax bill to raise revenue. Some discuss the timing coinciding with political maneuvers targeting the subsequent administration ([comment 44204793](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204793), [44183546](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44183546)).

- **Calls for Repeal:** There is bipartisan support for reverting the change, but legislative hurdles slow this process ([comment 44205290](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44205290)). Recent bills such as the "Big Beautiful Bill" aim to temporarily return to immediate expensing for 2025-2029.

- **Layoffs:** The tax change is pointed to as one factor (among others such as rising interest rates and cost-cutting practices) that has contributed to widespread layoffs in the tech sector ([comment 44188578](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44188578), [44204161](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204161)).

## 📚 Technical explanation in simple terms:

- Imagine a software company pays $1 million in salaries to developers in a year.
- Previously, they could subtract the full $1 million from their taxable profits immediately.
- Now, they can only subtract 20% of that $1 million in the first year, and the rest over the next four years.
- This means they appear to earn more profit on paper in the first year and owe more taxes upfront, reducing available cash.

## 📝 Simple Example

> "If you start a software company and pay 5 engineers each $100k annually, under the new rules, you can only deduct $100k (20%) of those salaries from your taxable income in year one. So if your revenue was $1M and expenses $500k, youd pay taxes on $900k instead of $500k, leading to a significant unexpected tax bill."
