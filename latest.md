The article "The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles" by Simon Willison offers a humorous yet insightful look at the rapid progress and current capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The author uses a quirky benchmark task‚Äîasking LLMs to generate SVG images of a pelican riding a bicycle‚Äîto evaluate and illustrate their limitations, especially in tasks not well suited for text-based models like SVG image generation.

### Technical Context üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶©
- LLMs typically excel at processing and generating text but struggle with complex, non-text tasks like drawing detailed SVG images.
- The pelican-on-a-bicycle SVG generation is a deliberate "inappropriate" test for these models, revealing that despite advanced training and high costs, LLMs often produce poor graphical outputs on such prompts.
- The benchmark highlights the gap between LLM hype and practical capabilities, showing that even state-of-the-art LLMs produce inconsistent, low-quality images [Source comment 44216191](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216191).
- The judging of model outputs was done using another LLM, which is efficient but raises questions about evaluation robustness and bias. Community members suggest alternative approaches like human expert evaluation or multiple LLM judges for better insights [Source comment 44216855](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216855).

### Why is it Popular? ü§î
- The playful premise of drawing pelicans on bicycles makes the complex topic of AI model evaluation more approachable and entertaining.
- It demystifies the perception that bigger and newer LLMs are flawless, providing a balanced view of their capabilities.
- The benchmark's simplicity and humor resonate with both AI researchers and the general public, creating buzz in the community.
- The discussion opens up important debates about the evaluation of AI models and the impact of widely known benchmarks leaking into training data and influencing results [Source comment 44216643](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216643).

### Community Conversations & Sentiment üí¨
- **Skepticism about LLM capabilities:** Many commenters point out that LLMs are primarily text generators and should not be expected to excel at purely graphical tasks like SVG drawing. This drives home the message that proper tool selection matters ([44216235](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216235)).
- **Benchmark limitations:** The community acknowledges that benchmarks like the pelican test can become less effective as they get incorporated into training data, making future models 'game' the tests ([44216643](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216643)). Some suggest new, evolving benchmarks to keep pace with AI advances.
- **Human vs AI drawing:** Discussions compare AI drawing capabilities to human efforts. Humans can improve through learning and judgment, while current LLMs lack consistent understanding or improvement on these tasks ([44218008](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44218008)).
- **Impact on industry and use cases:** Engineers and experts caution that LLM outputs are not yet reliable enough for complex engineering or production use cases, emphasizing the need for nuanced understanding and human oversight ([44216303](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216303)).
- **Excitement for experimentation:** Despite limitations, many users express enthusiasm to explore the creative possibilities of LLM-generated SVG and text outputs and are inspired by Simon‚Äôs playful approach ([44216055](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44216055)).
- **Memes and viral adoption:** The viral nature of the "pelican on a bicycle" prompt and similar memes reflects how AI benchmarks sometimes enter popular culture, influencing public perception ([44218461](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44218461)).

### Simple Example
Simon‚Äôs benchmark task involves a prompt like:

"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"

The model must output SVG code (a vector graphics format) by writing the code directly, rather than generating or editing an image file. This pushes the model into a challenging domain beyond text, showcasing its current technical limits.
