The article "How to modify Starlink Mini to run without the built-in WiFi router" by LorenDB explores a technical modification to the Starlink Mini satellite internet device. Starlink Mini is designed by SpaceX to provide satellite internet with a built-in WiFi router. The author discusses how to remove or disable the internal WiFi router completely to prevent any WiFi signals, which could be critical for use cases where stealth or reduced power consumption is necessary.

üîß **Technical Context:**
- The Starlink Mini includes an Ethernet jack and WiFi board. While the WiFi router can be turned off in settings, some users want to physically disable or remove the WiFi to ensure no signals are emitted during power-on or unexpected resets.
- The device uses modulated board-to-board Ethernet instead of direct RGMII from MAC to MAC, as discussed by community experts. This design choice eases prototyping and integration but raises questions about complexity and power consumption.
- Comments discuss alternatives and the engineering trade-offs involved, such as using Ethernet PHYs, handling signal integrity, and cost-saving tactics like removing isolation transformers.

üåü **Why Popular?**
- Starlink has gained huge attention for its revolutionary satellite internet capabilities, especially in areas with limited infrastructure.
- The modification addresses specific use cases like drones or front-line deployment in conflict zones (notably Ukraine), where reducing WiFi emissions can be crucial for safety and operational security.
- The post ties into broader geopolitical and military themes, as seen by references to Ukraine, Russia, and the Starlink usage in warfare, which engages a wide audience.
