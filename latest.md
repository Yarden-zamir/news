# Mechanical Watch: Exploded View - A Detailed Resin Art Project and Community Insights

This Hacker News article showcases an impressive side project by the author fellerts, who created an exploded view of a mechanical watch by carefully suspending over 300 tiny parts of a real watch in clear epoxy resin. The process took 15+ hours and showcases the intricate beauty of mechanical watch movements encased in resin, preserving the delicate components visibly displaced in 3D space. The project was inspired by Bartosz Ciechanowski's detailed blog on mechanical watches ([source](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)) and can be found here: [Mechanical Watch: Exploded View](https://fellerts.no/projects/epoch.html).

### Technical Highlights ðŸ”§
- Over 300 parts of the watch were individually suspended using nylon fishing lines with refractive index close to epoxy resin to minimize visibility.
- The author experimented with UV-stabilized resins to preserve transparency but found most epoxies eventually yellow with time ([Explanation and discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44347626), [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44347670)).
- Sanding and polishing the resin block to a flawless mirror finish is labor-intensive and typically requires specialized tools ([sanding tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44347875), [sanding discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44348159)).
- Tried casting thin epoxy rods to replace nylon lines for suspension but didn't fulfill expectations ([materials discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44348091)).
- Layer-by-layer embedding was attempted but found impractical due to difficulty achieving a smooth surface ([layer casting discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44347898)).

### Why is it Popular? ðŸŒŸ
- The project merges art, craftsmanship, and technical curiosity, drawing enthusiasts from watchmaking, resin casting, and mechanical model communities.
- Mechanical watches are cherished for their complexity; the project provides a unique visual insight into their inner workings.
- The detailed step-by-step and the homage to a revered mechanical watch blog ([Ciechanowski's blog](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)) resonates strongly with tech and craft aficionados.
- It sparks discussions about combining traditional craftsmanship with modern materials and techniques.
