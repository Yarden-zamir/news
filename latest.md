## What is the Precision Clock Mk IV? üï∞Ô∏è
The Precision Clock Mk IV is a highly technical, ultra-precise clock designed by ahlCVA, featuring millisecond precision and an innovative analog LED display that refreshes at an extremely high rate (up to 100 kHz). It avoids flicker even under high-speed cameras and does not use PWM (pulse width modulation) for brightness control, opting instead for analog voltage control to maintain steady brightness. The clock also auto-sets the timezone from GPS data without needing internet or a cellular connection. 

Key technical details:
- Millisecond precision with no perceptible jitter
- Display refreshes at 100 kHz per segment to eliminate flicker, even under 20,000+ fps cameras
- Uses GPS for precise time and timezone without internet, cellular modem, or SIM card
- LED segments driven continuously using variable voltage (analog control) rather than PWM

## Why is it popular? üåü
The clock represents an impressive blend of hardware engineering and software design, pushing the boundaries for a "simple" product like a clock. Its blend of practical features (such as GPS-based timezone detection without internet) with extreme precision and a flicker-free, smooth LED display captivates tech enthusiasts and engineers alike.

It stands out as both an art piece and a practical instrument, especially for those needing ultra-accurate time displays or anyone fascinated by hardware innovation. The detailed write-up showing design challenges and solutions has attracted admiration.

## Community Sentiments & Conversation Highlights üí¨

### Excitement and Appreciation:
- Many praise the detailed engineering write-up and the thought put into each design choice ([addaon](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44144892), [geerlingguy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145131), [mastax](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145397)).
- Users are excited to own or are already using the clock for precise synchronous tasks ([sstanfie](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145352), [geerlingguy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145131)).
- Appreciation for innovative analog LED driving that eliminates flicker even at high refresh rates, which is rare ([geerlingguy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145131), [gblargg](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145131)).

### Technical Discussions:
- The clock avoids PWM flicker by using variable voltage per LED segment, which is more complex and costly, but gives a high-quality visual output.
- Concern over flicker and photosensitive epilepsy clarified that the multiplexing frequency is very high (100 kHz) and outside the problematic range ([reconnecting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145073), [drivers99](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145315)).
