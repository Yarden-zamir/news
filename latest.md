# When ChatGPT Hallucinates a Feature and You End Up Building It

# Summary
This article tells a fascinating story about how OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI language model, mistakenly convinced users that a non-existent feature was available in Soundslice, a music notation tool. Specifically, ChatGPT hallucinated that Soundslice could import ASCII tablature for sheet music. This AI hallucination led to real users demanding this feature from Soundslice, prompting the developers to build it despite it being based on incorrect AI information.

# Technical Context
ChatGPT, based on large language models (LLMs), can generate plausible but inaccurate or false information, called "hallucinations." In this case, it hallucinated that Soundslice supported ASCII tablature import, which it did not. Users, trusting ChatGPT, tried to use this nonexistent feature, generating real market demand and feedback for the company to consider. The Soundslice team decided to meet the demand by adding support for ASCII tab import, essentially updating reality to match ChatGPT's hallucinated output.

# Why Itâ€™s Popular
This situation highlights the emerging dynamics between AI-generated misinformation and real-world product development, showcasing an unexpected new channel of market research and feature discovery known as "hallucination-driven development". It challenges traditional product management and raises important questions about how companies should respond to AI-generated user expectations.

# Community Conversation Highlights and Sentiments

- **Product Management & Market Fit:**
  Many commenters see this as a form of product-channel fitâ€”a new way to capture demand via AI-driven discovery ([comment 44491178](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491178)). One user called it free market research, where ChatGPT acts similarly to an enthusiastic sales team pushing hypothetical features to test user interest ([comment 44491402](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491402)).

- **Ethical and Practical Concerns:**
  Some express caution about building features in reaction to AI hallucinations, warning about potential endless cycles of responding to imaginary demands and conflicting LLM outputs ([comment 44491617](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491617)). Questions arise about the sustainability and responsibility involved.

- **Developer Experiences:**
  Programmers discussed using LLMs like GPT-4 for API design and bug detection by letting the AI "guess" and then adjusting accordingly, leveraging AI's creativity while verifying correctness ([comment 44491713](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491713)).

- **User Trust & AI Limitations:**
  Concern was voiced about general users trusting AI outputs without skepticism, leading to misunderstandings and misplaced blame on service providers when hallucinated features donâ€™t actually exist ([comment 44491943](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491943), [comment 44492514](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44492514)). This illustrates a broader societal challenge with AI literacy.

- **Humorous & Cultural Observations:**
  Several users shared amused or amazement reactions over the concept of AI hallucinations effectively pushing companies to innovate or pivot quickly, sometimes leading to unexpected business benefits ([comment 44493642](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44493642)).

# Example Usage
A developer noted how they prompt an LLM to "guess" how an API might work when docs are incomplete, then use this hallucination to identify UX or design improvements before formalizing the API ([comment 44491713](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44491713)). This approach turns AI hallucination into a creative brainstorming tool.
