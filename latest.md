# Airline Pilot Builds Interactive Visualizations of Flight Logs: Insights & Community Reactions

# Summary
James Harding, an airline pilot with a background in computer engineering, shared his personal project where he built interactive graphs and 3D globes visualizing his flight logs. The project leverages his digital logbook data, which is stored in a SQLite format via LogTen Pro, a popular pilot logbook software. The visualizations include flight paths on a globe, flight hours over time, and destination matrices, providing a fascinating glimpse into the life and career of a pilot.

# Technical Highlights
- **Data Source**: The flight data originates from LogTen Pro, stored internally as SQLite databases. James wrote scripts to extract and query this data for visualization.
- **Visualization Libraries**: The 3D globes use the [globe.gl](https://globe.gl/) library (built on Three.js for 3D WebGL rendering), while charts are made with nivo.rocks and other tools.
- **Challenges**: Actual flight route data is sometimes limited due to routes being stored in PDFs without APIs; geopolitical events like the Ukraine conflict affect routing.
- **Interactivity**: The visualizations are interactive, allowing exploration of various data dimensions such as roles on the plane (Captain, First Officer), aircraft types, and flight times.
