# Summary

An article on [DPReview](https://www.dpreview.com/photography/5400934096/probe-lenses-and-focus-stacking-the-secrets-to-incredible-photos-taken-inside-instruments) showcases incredible photographs taken *inside* musical instruments using specialized photography techniques such as probe lenses and focus stacking. These techniques allow capturing minute internal details of instruments like violins, guitars, and double basses by inserting tiny cameras inside through small holes.

# Technical Explanation

- **Probe Lenses:** These are very small camera lenses, often a few millimeters in diameter, allowing photographers to fit a camera inside tight spaces, such as a 5mm hole in a violin.
- **Focus Stacking:** A photography technique that combines multiple images taken at different focus distances to create one image with a greater depth of field and sharpness throughout.

Together, these techniques reveal intricate wood structures, repairs, and craftsmanship inside vintage string instruments, which are normally invisible to the naked eye.
