# Summary: Critical Discussion on Nvidia's Recent Practices and GPU Industry Trends

# Article Summary

The article "Nvidia is full of shit" critiques Nvidia's current strategy, particularly focusing on their consumer GPU market and engineering choices. The core argument is that Nvidia has shifted focus away from consumer products towards more profitable enterprise AI and data center chips, causing supply shortages, inflated prices, and compromised quality for gamers and regular users. The article also heavily criticizes Nvidia's 12VHPWR (12V-2x6) power connector design, which has been prone to overheating and melting, posing safety risks. It suggests this represents negligent engineering or even planned obsolescence.

Nvidia‚Äôs marketing is accused of being misleading ‚Äî especially regarding DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), frame generation, and ray tracing performance. The article claims consumers are being sold an illusion of progress rather than real hardware performance improvements, with high-end GPUs becoming luxury goods and gaming benefits marginal for the cost.

# Technical Explanation

- **DLSS & Frame Generation:** DLSS uses AI to upscale lower-resolution game rendering to higher resolutions, improving performance but sometimes introducing artifacts or input latency. Frame generation interpolates frames to increase perceived framerates but can add noticeable input lag.[Learn about DLSS](https://www.google.com/search?q=DLSS) [and Frame Generation](https://www.google.com/search?q=GPU+frame+generation)

- **12VHPWR Power Connector:** A high-power GPU power connector used on modern GPUs that bundles many wires to deliver up to 600W. Due to contact resistance and possible half-seated connectors, it can overheat, melt, and cause safety hazards. Nvidia released a revised 12V-2x6 connector to fix this, but issues persist. The problem is linked to the physical design and user handling.[Learn about 12VHPWR connector](https://www.google.com/search?q=12VHPWR+power+connector+melt)

- **Ray Tracing & Path Tracing:** New rendering techniques for realistic lighting effects that require enormous computational power, limiting their widespread use in consumer hardware as yet.[Learn about Ray Tracing](https://www.google.com/search?q=ray+tracing+gpu)

- **GPU Market Dynamics:** Nvidia dominates the GPU market with over 90% market share in PC gaming GPUs, but this dominance comes with criticism over pricing, stock availability, and aggressive marketing. AMD and Intel offer alternatives but Nvidia's CUDA platform remains dominant in AI and HPC sectors.[Learn about GPU market](https://www.google.com/search?q=GPU+market+share+Nvidia+AMD+Intel)
