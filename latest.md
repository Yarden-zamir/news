# Hyatt Hotels and Controversial Smoking Detectors 🚬🏨

Hyatt Hotels are using sensors called Rest to detect smoking 🚭. These use algorithms to identify tobacco and vape smoke, leading to fines (often $500) for violators. The tech promises accuracy, but guests report false positives often due to high humidity, dust, or non-smoking activities. Notably, the sensors promise revenue boosts, hinting they might prioritize profit over fairness.
