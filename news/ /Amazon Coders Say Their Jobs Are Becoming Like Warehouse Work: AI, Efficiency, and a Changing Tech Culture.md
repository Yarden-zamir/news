[At Amazon, some coders say their jobs have begun to resemble warehouse work](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/business/amazon-ai-coders.html)

Amazon engineers claim much of their work is shifting from creative problem-solving and code-writing to process-driven, task-oriented, and highly managed work—similar in feel to warehouse jobs. This transformation is catalyzed by the rapid adoption of AI tools that automate much of the coding process 🚀🤖, raising both productivity and management efficiency expectations, but leaving some programmers feeling like cogs in the corporate machine.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Details & Context

- **AI-Coding Assistants**: Tools like GitHub Copilot and other LLMs (Large Language Models) can now draft code and even generate proposals for software solutions given some bullet points or ideas. Coders must spend less time writing code from scratch and more time reviewing, testing, and debugging AI-generated output ([44087475](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087475)).
- **Shift in Work Nature**: More time is spent reading & reviewing code, less on original programming. Code review and bug-chasing are becoming dominant tasks ([44087525](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087525)).
- **Productivity Measurement**: Increased reliance on metrics—like tasks (tickets) closed per day—mirrors factory assembly-line management ([44087517](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087517)). Pressure is up, autonomy is down.
- **Quality vs. Quantity**: Some comments express concern that a focus on speed and output, aided by AI, sacrifices code quality, maintainability, and long-term value for short-term gains ([44089971](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44089971)).

## 🔥 Why Is This Popular?

- **AI Hype**: Massive interest in real-world impacts of AI at the workplace—Amazon is a global bellwether.
- **Work Culture Change**: Broad relevance: White-collar work across industries is facing similar transformations as manufacturing/warehouse work did decades ago.
- **Community Concern**: Programmers everywhere are anxious: Will their high-status, creative job become low-autonomy digital drudgery?
- **Debate on Economic Justice**: There's poetic irony—programmers who've automated others' jobs for decades now fear automation themselves. This stirs both empathy and schadenfreude.

- Many say reviewing and debugging AI-generated code has taken the fun out of the job ([44087475](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087475)), while others find puzzle-solving and bug-hunting still rewarding ([44087525](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087525)).

**2. AI = Productivity or ‘Slop-Pile’ Coding?**
- Concerns abound about companies cutting quality to hit output targets, relying on AI to hit deadlines but risking disastrous long-term consequences ([44093663](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44093663), [44089971](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44089971))
- Some argue codebases are already a mess and AI will speed up inevitable decay, while others see potential to automate the boring parts and focus on higher-level work ([44087636](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087636)).

**3. "Warehouse Work" is Nothing New**
- Some say this has always been the reality in large, process-driven tech environments, and AI merely exposes it ([44087609](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087609), [44089753](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44089753)).

**4. Class, Automation, and Working Conditions**
- Heated debate: Are software devs now just another replaceable working class? Should they organize collectively, unionize, or continue to see themselves as a privileged elite ([44087693](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087693), [44088544](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44088544))?

**5. Amazon's Unique Flavor:**
- Some insiders say the portrayal of Amazon is exaggerated ([44087646](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087646)), but others back up the claims of micromanagement, persistent productivity monitoring, and aggressive AI rollout ([44087715](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087715)).

### Notable and Divisive Comments
- **Divisions**: Should devs focus on upping their AI game to stay ahead or should they unionize & organize for better conditions ([44088651](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44088651))? The chat is split: hustle harder or fight for worker rights? 👷‍♂️✊

- **Cynicism/Sarcasm**: Many see management as just running the same “do more with less” trick with new paint on the assembly line 🚋 ([44087539](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44087539)).

- **Vibe Coding**: Some fear a future where code is generated based on vague English specs and reviewed only by more distracted humans ([44093663](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44093663)).

- **Technical Worries**: Others question who will understand or maintain this AI slop in five years, worrying about ‘shitpile singularity’ ([44093663](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44093663), [44089971](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44089971))

## 📜 Simple Example / Analogy

> Imagine you used to be a woodworker making furniture by hand. Now, a robot builds the chair, and your job is to check that each chair is okay; you have to do it quickly, don’t have time for creativity, and you’re told to check twice as many as before. Fun? Or factory job? That’s how many Amazon coders describe their new daily reality.
